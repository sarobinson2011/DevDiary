**A blog detailing my journey into web3 development...**

 
 *"Every artist was first an amateur."* - Ralph Waldo Emerson (1841)


About me:

After 20 years in electrical/electronic engineering focused on high speed digital design / embedded software in the space industry... it's time for a new challenge.

Enter blockchain development, smart contracts, web3

Experience: 

C:          intermediate
VHDL:       advanced   
Python:     intermediate
Solidity:   6 months self-taught    

First steps:

So, I've spent a little over 6 months learning the basics of solidity, the EVM and contract deployment / interaction.  This involved trialing a number of development frameworks, namely:

    - Truffle - JavaScript
    - Hardhat - JavaScript
    - Brownie - Python
    - Ganache - local blockchain network
    - Remix   - online IDE

The Remix online editor proved to be good for rapid examples and learning, it's online and somewhat closed nature makes it unsuitable for my liking, I need more flexibility.

Since my Python skills are considerably more advanced than my JavaScript skills, I decided to use the following development setup:

    - VS Code
    - Ganache CLI - for initial testing at the 'logical' level
    - Brownie 
    - Sepolia 

All development / deployments will be done from a dedicated dev Ethereum address, on the 'Sepolia' testnet.
