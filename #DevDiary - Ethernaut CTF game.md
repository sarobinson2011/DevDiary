Ethernaut

Ethernaut is a Capture the Flag (CTF) game, designed specifically for learning and practicing Ethereum smart contract security through interactive challenges. It helps developers and students understand and identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

The challenges are hands-on exercises that require participants to analyse and exploit vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. These challenges cover a wide range of security topics, such as re-entrancy attacks, authorization flaws etc. Whilst simultaneously promoting "best practice" for writing efficient, secure solidity code.

I will be playing the game by interacting with the Ethereum smart contracts through a web-based interface using:

    Firefox's developer console - connected to the Ethernaut website
    VS Code
    Solidity 
    Python-Brownie framework (for interaction, testing and deployment)


Thought process

Here's how I propose to approach the individual challenges:

    Read (and then re-read) the challenge: Understand the challenge's objective
    Coding Tools: Employ external code as appropriate, via VS Code and Brownie
    Interact with the Contract: Attack the contract as above (poke and prod)
    Find Vulnerabilities: Identify security weaknesses or vulnerabilities
    Solve the Challenge: Exploit found vulnerability to complete the task

 

Easy right?   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
